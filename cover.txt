I'm a software engineer and a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo in Canada. I have built multiple full-stack applications using a variety of technologies (Ruby, Rails, Javascript, Postgres, Mongo) and am always looking to learn new things.

My latest project was an asynchronous web server that allows users to host, join, and play instances of the popular board game, The Resistance: Avalon, with each other. Players can use their computers or laptops (it's web-mobile compatible), and can play remotely over the internet or in the same room. It uses a publish/subscribe pattern and each instance listens to a shared reactive game object to synchronize game flow.

I also made a clone of Pinterest, the popular photo sharing website, from scratch in 10 days. Built in Ruby on Rails and Backbone, it features custom user authentication using a salt+hash method, related photos using user generated associations, and a news feed through user follow capabilities.

More details of my work can be seen on my portfolio (alantran.co) and I'd love to hear from you soon.
