## Key Features

**Computer AI** Features an intelligence computer opponent that responds defensively. Continues in a straight line until it detects an obstacle, then calculates the available area to the left of the imminent collision and the area to the right, and chooses the option with the greatest area.

**Boosts** Players have a limited number of boosts that increases the speed of the player by 2x. Computer players will use their boosts randomly to catch the human player off guard.

**Scalable Design** Tron can be easily scaled to support a bigger map, or more players/computer players by using modular design.
